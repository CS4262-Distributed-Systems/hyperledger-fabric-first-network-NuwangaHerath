I got better understanding about a blockchain network, its components and how it works.

``Peers`` : A blockchain network is comprised primarily of a set of peer nodes. Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts.

``Ledgers`` : The ledger is the record of all state transitions in the fabric. State transitions are a result of chaincode invocations submitted by participating parties. Transaction are committed to the ledger as creates, updates, or deletes.

``Smart Contracts`` : A smart contract defines the executable logic that generates new facts that are added to the ledger.

``Chaincodes`` : Chaincode is software defining an asset or assets, and the transaction instructions for modifying the assets. A chaincode is typically used by administrators to group related smart contracts for deployment, but can also be used for low level system programming of Fabric.

A chaincode network consist with multiple organizations which have their own peers. Peers are connecting with other peers in the network using channels. Peers connected via a same channel maintains/host a same copy of a ledger and a smart contract(a.k.a. chaincode). Also a peer can connect to multiple channels which means that peer has to host seperate ledgers and smart contracts(chaincodes) for each channels.
